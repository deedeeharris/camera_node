todo
* update 1 and 2, to latest, including reinstalling reqs.txt (since we transformed to ws)
* configure the rasberry pi 4 with a hotspot, with set gateway, and then configure the nodes, 
with set static ip addresses, and automaticly connect to the main rasberry pi 4. 
* create the main server, to handle the concurrent imaging like in get_images.py,
and also a queue for uploading the images, etc. 


# 13/02

worked on node 1
still having errors. 
didn't succeed to capture yet in the current setup.

end of day - last update
worked hours, trying to get the raw format from the camera_node
to the client. always errors.
checked online. maybe i dont need raw. maybe jpeg is enough.
do another research online, to see if jpeg is enough.
if enough, transform all do jpeg.
or consider maybe tiff, or dng.
looks like jpg is enough. make it dynamic, either jpg or dng.
